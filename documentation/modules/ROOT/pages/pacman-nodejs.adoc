= Pacman App
:navtitle: Pacman App

In this section, we're going to deploy a pacman application, developed in nodejs that will expose 2 main REST endpoints to the visualizer
application (`pacman` web component that was deployed in the previous labs).
The application will query for user stats and high scores information that is stored in a MongoAtlas database.  This application will also
provide an external access point, so that the URL provided can be directly used
by the end user to play pacman game.

[#source_to_image]
== Background: Source-to-Image (S2I)

In a previous lab, we learned how to deploy a pre-existing image
image. Now we will expand on that by learning how OpenShift builds
container images using source code from an existing repository.  This is accomplished using the Source-to-Image project.

https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image[Source-to-Image (S2I)] is a
open source project sponsored by Red Hat that has the following goal:

[source]
----
Source-to-image (S2I) is a tool for building reproducible container images. S2I
produces ready-to-run images by injecting source code into a container image and
assembling a new container image which incorporates the builder image and built
source. The result is then ready to use with docker run. S2I supports
incremental builds which re-use previously downloaded dependencies, previously
built artifacts, etc.
----

OpenShift is S2I-enabled and can use S2I as one of its build mechanisms (in
addition to building container images from Dockerfiles, and "custom" builds).

OpenShift runs the S2I process inside a special *Pod*, called a Build
Pod, and thus builds are subject to quotas, limits, resource scheduling, and
other aspects of OpenShift.

A full discussion of S2I is beyond the scope of this class, but you can find
more information about it either in the
{openshift-docs-url}/creating_images/s2i.html[OpenShift S2I documentation]
or on https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image[GitHub]. The only key concept you need to
remember about S2I is that it's magic.

[#creating_pacman-nodejs_application]
== Exercise: Creating a Pacman application

The backend service that we will be deploying as part of this exercise is
called `pacman` which is a game,

[#add_to_project]
=== Add to Project
Because the `pacman` component is a backend to serve data that our
existing frontend (pacman) will consume, we are going to build it inside the existing
project that we have been working with. To illustrate how you can interact with OpenShift via the CLI or the web console, we will deploy the pacman component using the web console.

[#using_application_code_on_git_server]
=== Using Application Code on Git Server

OpenShift can work with any accessible Git repository. This could be GitHub,
GitLab, or any other server that speaks Git. You can even register webhooks in
your Git server to initiate OpenShift builds triggered by any update to the
application code!

link:https://github.com/veniceofcode/pacman.git[Pacman GitHub Repository]


Later in the lab, we want you to make a code change and then rebuild your
application. This is a fairly simple Spring framework Java application.

[#build_code_on_openshift]
=== Build the Code on OpenShift

Similar to how we used *+Add* before with an existing image, we
can do the same for specifying a source code repository. Since for this lab you
have your own git repository, let's use it with a simple Java S2I image.

In the Developer Perspective, click *+Add* in the left navigation, go to the *Git Repository* section and then choose *From Git* option.

image::pacman-show-add-options.png[Add to Project,800,align="center"]

The *Import from Git* workflow will guide you through the process of deploying your app based on a few selections.

Enter the following for Git Repo URL:

[source,bash,role=copypaste]
----
https://github.com/veniceofcode/pacman.git
----

OpenShift will automatically guess the Git server type and the programming language used by the source code. You will be now asked to select an *Import Strategy*.

Click *Edit Import Strategy*.

image::pacman-import-strategy.png[Select Import Strategy]

You have three options: 

* *Devfile*: this will use link:https://devfile.io/docs/devfile/2.1.0/user-guide/index.html[Devfile v2] spec to create an application stack. The repo has to contain a file named `devfile.yaml` in the Devfile v2 format .
* *Dockerfile*: this will create a Container image from an existing Dockerfile. 
* *Builder Image*: this will use a mechanism called Source-to-Image to create automatically a container image directly from the source code.

Select *Build Image* as we are going to create the container image from the source code, as discussed in the next section.

image::pacman-new-nodejs-build.png[Select Import Strategy]


TIP: You could also use Dockerfile, the repo contains a multi-stage Dockerfile. For this exercise, we want to show the Build Image feature.


Verify that *Java* has been selected as your Builder Image, and be sure to select version *openjdk-11-ubi8* to have OpenJDK 11.

Scroll down to the *General* section. Add the following:

*Application Name* :
[source,role=copypaste]
----
pacman
----

*Name* :
[source,role=copypaste]
----
pacman
----

In *Resources* section, select *Deployment*.

NOTE: If present, leave Pipeline section empty here as we will implement it in the next modules

Under *Advanced Options*, ensure *Create a route to the application* is *checked* here.

We are going to create another *Secure Route*, this time directly from this view.

Click *Show advanced Routing options*. 

Leave all default options, go under *Security* section.

Check *Secure Route* option.

Under *TLS termination*, select *Edge*.

Scroll down and expand the *Labels* section to add 3 labels.

The name of the Application group:

[source,role=copypaste]
----
app=pacman
----

Next the name of this deployment.

[source,role=copypaste]
----
component=pacman
----

And finally, the role this component plays in the overall application.

[source,role=copypaste]
----
role=ui
----

Click *Create* to submit.

To see the build logs, in Topology view, click the `pacman` entry, then click on *View Logs* in the *Builds* section of the *Resources* tab.

This is a nodejs based application that uses Maven as the build and dependency system.  For this reason, the initial build
will take a few minutes as Maven downloads all of the dependencies needed for
the application. You can see all of this happening in real time!

From the command line, you can also see the *Builds*:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
oc get builds
= ----

You'll see output like:

[.console-output]
[source,bash]
----
NAME       TYPE     FROM          STATUS     STARTED      DURATION
pacman-1   Source   Git@1c647d5   Complete   2 days ago   58s
----


You can also view the build logs with the following command:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
oc logs -f builds/pacman-1
----

After the build has completed and successfully:

* The S2I process will push the resulting image to the internal OpenShift registry
* The *Deployment* (D) will detect that the image has changed, and this
  will cause a new deployment to happen.
* A *ReplicaSet* (RS) will be spawned for this new deployment.
* The RS will detect no *Pods* are running and will cause one to be deployed, as our default replica count is just 1.

In the end, when issuing the `oc get pods` command, you will see that the build Pod
has finished (exited) and that an application *Pod* is in a ready and running state:

[.console-output]
[source,bash]
----
NAME                    READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
pacman-1-tkid3   1/1       Running     3          2m
pacman-1-build   0/1       Completed   0          3m
pacman-57df75c46d-xltcs        1/1       Running     0          2h
----

If you look again at the web console, you will notice that, when you create the
application this way, OpenShift also creates a *Route* for you. You can see the
URL in the web console, or via the command line:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
oc get routes

----

image::101.png[Pacman Console 800,align="center"]

Where you should see something like the following:

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
NAME     HOST/PORT                                                 PATH   SERVICES   PORT       TERMINATION     WILDCARD
pacman   pacman-pacman.apps.maverick.lab.upshift.rdu2.redhat.com          pacman     8080-tcp   edge/Redirect   None
bash-4.4 ~ $ 
----

In the above example, the URL is:

[source,text,role="copypaste",subs="+attributes"]
----
https://pacman-%PROJECT%.%CLUSTER_SUBDOMAIN%
----

WARNING: If the Pod is Running and the application is not available, please wait till we connect it to the MongoAtlas in the cloud as we don't have a database. Yet.
