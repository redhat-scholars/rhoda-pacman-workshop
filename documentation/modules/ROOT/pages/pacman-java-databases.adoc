= Connecting to a Database
:navtitle: Connecting to a Database

In this section we will deploy and connect a MongoDB database where the
`pacman` application will store location information.

Finally, we will mark the `pacman` application as a backend for the map
visualization tool, so that it can be dynamically discovered by the `parksmap`
component using the OpenShift discovery mechanism and the map will be displayed
automatically.

[#storage]
== Background: Storage

Most useful applications are "stateful" or "dynamic" in some way, and this is
usually achieved with a database or other data storage. In this lab we are
going to add MongoDB to our `pacman` application and then rewire it to
talk to the database using environment variables via a secret.

We are going to use the MongoDB image that is included with OpenShift.

By default, this will use *EmptyDir* for data storage, which means if the *Pod*
disappears the data does as well. In a real application you would use
OpenShift's persistent storage mechanism to attach real-world storage (NFS,
Ceph, EBS, iSCSI, etc) to the *Pods* to give them a persistent place to store their
data.

[#bg_sb_lib]
== Background: Service binding libraries
The Kubernetes service binding feature was introduced to bring consistency to the way secrets are shared for connecting applications to external services, such as REST APIs, databases, and many other services.
OpenShift Database Access leverages the service binding feature to bring a low-touch administrative experience to provisioning, and managing access to external database services.
The service binding feature enables developers to connect their applications to database services with a consistent, and predictable experience.
Specifically, a service binding creates a volume on the application pod, and organizes the information to make a connection to the database in a directory structure.
The volume mount point is exposed as an environment variable. Developer frameworks, such as Quarkus, are service binding aware, and can automatically connect to a database using this exposed workload information without needing to embed database connection information in the application source code.

[#prereq_rhoda]
== Prerequisites: Things to Do befor configuring MongoDB Atlas

In order to run the lab in your cluster, you need to meet the requirements discussed below.

[cols="2*^,2*.",options="header,+attributes"]
|===
|**Component**|**Version**

| https://www.openshift.com/try[OpenShift]
| `{openshift-version}`
|===

In the following modules you will find out other prerequisites when needed.


[#deploy_mongodb]

[#access_mongodb]
== Exercise : Accessing the database access menu for configuring and monitoring


[#find_mongodb_creds]
== Exercise: Find your MongoDB Atlas account credentials


[#access_dbaas_console]

[#play_pacman]
== Exercise: Play Pacman and save your high scores


As soon as we attached the Secret to the *Deployment*, some
magic happened. OpenShift decided that this was a significant enough change to
warrant updating the internal version number of the *ReplicaSet*. You
can verify this by looking at the output of `oc get rs`:

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
NAME                       DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
nationalparks-58bd4758fc   0         0         0       4m58s
nationalparks-7445576cd9   0         0         0       6m42s
nationalparks-789c6bc4f4   1         1         1       41s
parksmap-57df75c46d        1         1         1       8m24s
parksmap-65c4f8b676        0         0         0       18m
----

We see that the DESIRED and CURRENT number of instances for the current deployment. The desired and current number of the other instances are 0.
This means that OpenShift has gracefully torn down our "old" application and
stood up a "new" instance.



[#data_data_everywhere]
== Exercise: Data, Data, Everywhere

Now that we have a database deployed, we can again visit the `nationalparks` web
service to query for data:

[source,role="copypaste",subs="+attributes"]
----
https://nationalparks-%PROJECT%.%CLUSTER_SUBDOMAIN%/ws/data/all
----

And the result?

[.console-output]
[source,bash]
----
[]
----

Where's the data? Think about the process you went through. You deployed the
application and then deployed the database. Nothing actually loaded anything
*INTO* the database, though.

The application provides an endpoint to do just that:

[source,role="copypaste",subs="+attributes"]
----
https://nationalparks-%PROJECT%.%CLUSTER_SUBDOMAIN%/ws/data/load
----

And the result?

[.console-output]
[source,bash]
----
Items inserted in database: 2893
----

If you then go back to `/ws/data/all` you will see tons of JSON data now.
That's great. Our parks map should finally work!

NOTE: There are some errors reported with browsers like Firefox 54 that don't properly parse the resulting JSON. It's
a browser problem, and the application is working properly.

[source,role="copypaste",subs="+attributes"]
----
https://parksmap-%PROJECT%.%CLUSTER_SUBDOMAIN%
----

Hmm... There's just one thing. The main map **STILL** isn't displaying the parks.
That's because the front end parks map only tries to talk to services that have
the right *Label*.

[NOTE]
====
You are probably wondering how the database connection magically started
working? When deploying applications to OpenShift, it is always best to use
environment variables, secrets, or configMaps to define connections to dependent systems.  This allows
for application portability across different environments.  The source file that
performs the connection as well as creates the database schema can be viewed
here:


[source,role="copypaste"]
----
http://www.github.com/openshift-roadshow/nationalparks/blob/master/src/main/java/com/openshift/evg/roadshow/parks/db/MongoDBConnection.java#L44-l48
----

In short summary: By referring to bindings to connect to services
(like databases), it can be trivial to promote applications throughout different
lifecycle environments on OpenShift without having to modify application code.

[#working_with_labels]
== Exercise: Working With Labels

We explored how a *Label* is just a key=value pair earlier when looking at
*Services* and *Routes* and *Selectors*. In general, a *Label* is simply an
arbitrary key=value pair. It could be anything.

* `pizza=pepperoni`
* `pet=dog`
* `openshift=awesome`

In the case of the parks map, the application is actually querying the OpenShift
API and asking about the *Routes* and *Services* in the project. If any of them have a
*Label* that is `type=parksmap-backend`, the application knows to interrogate
the endpoints to look for map data.
You can see the code that does this
link:https://github.com/openshift-roadshow/parksmap-web/blob/master/src/main/java/com/openshift/evg/roadshow/rest/RouteWatcher.java#L20[here].


Fortunately, the command line provides a convenient way for us to manipulate
labels. `describe` the `nationalparks` service:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
oc describe route nationalparks
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]

You see that it already has some labels. Now, use `oc label`:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
oc label route nationalparks type=parksmap-backend
----

You will see something like:

[.console-output]
[source,bash]
----
route.route.openshift.io/nationalparks labeled
----

If you check your browser now:

[source,role="copypaste",subs="+attributes"]
----
https://parksmap-%PROJECT%.%CLUSTER_SUBDOMAIN%/
----

image::nationalparks-databases-new-parks.png[MongoDB]

You'll notice that the parks suddenly are showing up. That's really cool!
