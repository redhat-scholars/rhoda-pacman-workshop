= Connecting to a Database
:navtitle: Connecting to a Database

In this section we will deploy and connect a MongoDB database where the
`pacman` application will store location information.

Finally, we will mark the `pacman` application as a backend for the map
visualization tool, so that it can be dynamically discovered by the `parksmap`
component using the OpenShift discovery mechanism and the map will be displayed
automatically.

[#storage]
== Background: Storage

Most useful applications are "stateful" or "dynamic" in some way, and this is
usually achieved with a database or other data storage. In this lab we are
going to add MongoDB to our `pacman` application and then rewire it to
talk to the database using environment variables via a secret.

We are going to use the MongoDB image that is included with OpenShift.

By default, this will use *EmptyDir* for data storage, which means if the *Pod*
disappears the data does as well. In a real application you would use
OpenShift's persistent storage mechanism to attach real-world storage (NFS,
Ceph, EBS, iSCSI, etc) to the *Pods* to give them a persistent place to store their
data.

[#bg_sb_lib]
== Background: Service binding libraries
The Kubernetes service binding feature was introduced to bring consistency to the way secrets are shared for connecting applications to external services, such as REST APIs, databases, and many other services.
OpenShift Database Access leverages the service binding feature to bring a low-touch administrative experience to provisioning, and managing access to external database services.
The service binding feature enables developers to connect their applications to database services with a consistent, and predictable experience.
Specifically, a service binding creates a volume on the application pod, and organizes the information to make a connection to the database in a directory structure.
The volume mount point is exposed as an environment variable.
Developer frameworks, such as Quarkus, are service binding aware, and can automatically connect to a database using this exposed workload information without needing to embed database connection information in the application source code.

Here are some application examples on how to use a service binding library:

[#prereq_rhoda]
== Prerequisites: Things to Do before configuring MongoDB Atlas

* A Red Hat user account to access the link:https://console.redhat.com/[Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console].
* An instance of OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) 4.9 or higher running on Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated (OSD), or Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA).
** When using OSD or ROSA, an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account and credentials are required.
* Access to the OpenShift Cluster Manager (OCM) console.
* A service account with either the link:https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database[MongoDB Atlas], or link:https://www.crunchydata.com[Crunchy Data Bridge], or link:https://www.cockroachlabs.com[CockroachDB] cloud database provider.
* An existing database instance running on one of these cloud database providers: MongoDB Atlas, Crunchy Data Bridge, or CockroachDB.

In order to run the lab in your cluster, you need to meet the requirements discussed below.

In the following modules you will find out other prerequisites when needed.


[#deploy_mongodb]
== Exercise: Deploy MongoDB




















[#access_mongodb]
== Exercise : Accessing the database access menu for configuring and monitoring

















[#find_mongodb_creds]
== Exercise: Find your MongoDB Atlas account credentials

You need the Organization ID, the Organization Public Key, and the Organization Private Key to create a provider account resource for MongoDB Atlas.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If using MongoDB Atlas as a cloud-database provider, then you must add the IP address of the application pod to MongoDB Atlas' IP Access List.
If the IP address is not in the IP Access List, then a 504 gateway timeout error occurs.
Visit the MongoDB Atlas link:https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/security/ip-access-list/[website] for more details on adding an IP address to your database project.

.Procedure

. From the MongoDB Atlas link:https://www.mongodb.com/[home page], **Sign In** to your account.

. From your account home page:
