[#deploy_web_terminal]
== Create the RHODA catalog source using OpenShift Web Terminal 

*Note* 

We need below step if we are trying to deploy RHODA without using the Add-On, For example in an OpenShift Cluster deployed on-premise.

Launch Web Terminal from OpenShift console and perform below steps*

----
cat <<EOF | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: CatalogSource
metadata:
name: dbaas-operator
namespace: openshift-marketplace
spec:
sourceType: grpc
image: quay.io/osd-addons/dbaas-operator-index@sha256:6325f547b394b1d6f7a528ab3c01bb8f9052762acc245fd453378f5a47830923
displayName: DBaaS Operator
EOF
----
----
bash-4.4 ~ $ oc get catalogsource dbaas-operator -n openshift-marketplace
NAME             DISPLAY          TYPE   PUBLISHER   AGE
dbaas-operator   DBaaS Operator   grpc               3d23h
----

* Verify that dbaas-operator catalog source is in READY state, It might take a few minutes before the catalog source is ready. If the below command does not return READY, wait a few minutes and try to verify the status again. 

You can also check this by going into openshift-marketplace namespace dbass-operator catalog pod

----
oc get catalogsource -n openshift-marketplace  dbaas-operator -o jsonpath='{.status.connectionState.lastObservedState} {"\n"}'
----

----
oc describe packagemanifests dbaas-operator -n openshift-marketplace
----

* Go to Operator Hub and look for OpenShift Database Access Operator

* Once Selected the OpenShift Database Access Operator,

* Navigate in the web console to the Operators → OperatorHub page.
Type a keyword into the Filter by keyword box OpenShift Database Access Operator.
Select the OpenShift Database Access Operator  to display additional information.

On the Install Operator page. The RHODA operator is cluster scope and the default installed namespace is openshift-dbaas-operator and use the same default settings.

* On successful installation of RHODA operator, will automatically install all its dependencies including provider operators, console plugins as seen in the screenshot and you see an additional menu with name Data Services in the end of menu list. Once all it’s components installation completed the dbaas operator pod logs will shows: DBaaS platform stack installation complete.

//* Create a Provider Account depending on the the managed database that the application needs to connect to
//
//* You can create a provider account resource that represents an account with a cloud database provider.
//* By providing the correct authentication credentials for the cloud database provider, you can fetch the available database instances.
//
//*NOTE:* For the Service Preview release of OpenShift Database Access, there is only a single namespace.
//
//.*Procedure*
//
//. Log into the OpenShift Cluster Manager console.
//
//. Select the correct project namespace.

[#deploy_kustomize]
== Install RHODA using Kustomize

Kustomize traverses a Kubernetes manifest to add, remove or update configuration options without forking. It is available both as a standalone binary and as a native feature of kubectl.

For more information on using Kustomize, please refer to the following https://kustomize.io/[link]

Please use the following : https://github.com/redhat-cop/gitops-catalog/tree/main/rhoda-operator/operator[URL]

[#deploy_ansible]
== Install using Ansible

Ansible is a software tool that provides simple but powerful automation for cross-platform computer support. It is primarily intended for IT professionals, who use it for application deployment, updates on workstations and servers, cloud provisioning, configuration management, intra-service orchestration, and nearly anything a systems administrator does on a weekly or daily basis. Ansible doesn't depend on agent software and has no additional security infrastructure, so it's easy to deploy.

For information on using Ansible, please refer to the https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html[link]

Using below manifest, we can install using AAP or run as a playbook manually by creating necessary artifacts.

[#deploy_ocp_pipelines]
== Install using OpenShift Pipelines 

Red Hat OpenShift Pipelines is a cloud-native, continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) solution based on Kubernetes resources. It uses Tekton building blocks to automate deployments across multiple platforms by abstracting away the underlying implementation details. Tekton introduces a number of standard custom resource definitions (CRDs) for defining CI/CD pipelines that are portable across Kubernetes distributions

Please refer to https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.10/cicd/pipelines/understanding-openshift-pipelines.html[docs]

Use below links for the pipeline related manifest.
