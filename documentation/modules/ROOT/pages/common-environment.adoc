The workshop can be run on an OpenShift environment that is running on a
public cloud.


OpenShift Container Platform is a platform for developing and running containerized applications. It is designed to allow applications and the data centers that support them to expand from just a few machines and applications to thousands of machines that serve millions of clients.

With its foundation in Kubernetes, OpenShift Container Platform incorporates the same technology that serves as the engine for massive telecommunications, streaming video, gaming, banking, and other applications. Its implementation in open Red Hat technologies lets you extend your containerized applications beyond a single cloud to on-premise and multi-cloud environments.


The environment consists of the following components:

* Master node(s)
* Compute nodes
* Dynamic Provisioned Storage
* Private Container Registry
* Routing Layer
