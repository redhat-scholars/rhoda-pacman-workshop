= Webhooks with OpenShift
:navtitle: Webhooks with OpenShift

As we discussed in the previous module, OpenShift provides the Source-2-Image mechanism to create containers by defining a `BuildConfig`. In addition to that, it provides link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/{openshift-version}/cicd/builds/triggering-builds-build-hooks.html[triggers,window='_blank'] to control the circumstances in which the BuildConfig should be run, such as Webhooks.

[#prerequisite_github_account]
== Prerequisite: GitHub Account

We will demonstrate the automation capability with OpenShift, and in order to do this, we need you to have an account on https://github.com[GitHub,window='_blank'].

If you don't have an account on GitHub, please create one https://github.com/join[here,window='_blank'].

[#webhooks]
== Background: Webhooks

Most Git repository servers support the concept of web hooks -- calling to an
external source via HTTP(S) when a change in the code repository happens.
OpenShift provides an API endpoint that supports receiving hooks from
remote systems in order to trigger builds. By pointing the code repository's
hook at the OpenShift API, automated code/build/deploy can be
achieved.

[#webhooks_with_openshift]
== Exercise: Webhooks with OpenShift
In this lab you can use a build webhook to trigger a build execution every time there is a change in your copy of the pacman GitHub repository. In the OpenShift web console, navigate to your **%PROJECT%** project, and then click to **Builds**. Click the `pacman` BuildConfig and then go to the **Webhooks** section.

On this screen you will see the option to copy the GitHub webhook URL, click to **Copy URL with Secret** as shown in the following image:

[#fork_repository_from_github]
== Exercise: Fork pacman repository from GitHub

A link:https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo[fork,window='_blank'] is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

In this step we will fork the original `pacman` repository to apply our changes and automatically trigger the Pipeline through a link:https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/developers/webhooks-and-events/about-webhooks[GitHub Webhook,window='_blank'] that we're going to configure.

Go to link:https://github.com/veniceofcode/pacman[Pacman,window='_blank'] repository. From top-right side, click to *Fork* to start forking it into your account.

Select your account, and click *Fork*

image::fork2.png[Fork already exists]

Your repository is forked , we can start adding our automation to that.

[#configuring_github_webhooks]
== Exercise: Configuring GitHub Web Hooks


Once you have forked the repository and you have the Webhook URL with Secret copied to your clipboard, navigate to the code repository fork that you have on GitHub.

From your fork page top-right menu, click *Settings*. Then from result left-side menu, click *Webhook*, then from right side click *Add webhooks*.

In the next screen, paste your link into the "Payload URL" field. You can leave the
secret token field blank -- the secret is already in the URL and does not need
to be in the payload.

Change the `Content Type` to `application/json`.

Finally, click on *Add Webhook*.

Boom! From now on, every time you commit new source code to your GitHub
repository, a new build and deploy will occur inside of OpenShift.  Let's try
this out.

[#using_github_webhooks]
== Exercise: Using GitHub Web Hooks
Click the *Code* tab in GitHub. This is GitHub's repository view.  

CAUTION: Make sure that the drop-down menu at the upper right is set for 
the *`master`* branch. Navigate to the
following path:

[.console-output]
[source,bash]
----
https://github.com/veniceofcode/pacman/blob/master/lib/database.js
----

Then click on the `BackendController.java` file.

Once you have the file on the screen, click the edit button in the top right
hand corner as shown here:

image::nationalparks-codechanges-github-change-code.png[Webhook]

Change line number 65:

[source,java]
----
 console.log('Connected to database successfully');
----

To

[source,java,role="copypaste"]
----
 console.log('Connected to mongo database successfully');
----

Click on *Commit changes* at the bottom of the screen. Feel free to enter a commit message.

Once you have committed your changes, a new *Build* should almost instantaneously be
triggered in OpenShift. From OpenShift Web Console, click **Builds**->**pacman** and then navigate to the **Builds**. You should see a new one running: 

image::nationalparks-codechanges-build-running.png[Webhook]

or run the following command to verify:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
oc get builds
----

Once the build and deploy has finished, verify your new image was automatically deployed by viewing the application in your browser:


link:https://managed-pacman-managed-pacman.apps.rhodalab.yoir.p1.openshiftapps.com/[Pacman Page,role='params-link',window='_blank']

You should now be able to play pacman
